The solution depends on the root cause of the incompatibility.  Here are two approaches:

**1. Find an Expo-compatible alternative:**

If the library causing the issue doesn't have direct Expo support, search for alternative packages that achieve similar functionality and are compatible with Expo's managed workflow.

**2. Switch to a Bare Workflow (if feasible):**

For complex projects needing complete control over native modules and functionalities, consider switching to Expo's bare workflow. This allows full access to native code but requires more in-depth understanding of native development.

// Example illustrating a potential solution (assuming 'unavailable-library' is the problematic package)

// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native'; // Expo-compatible components
import * as ExpoLocation from 'expo-location'; // Example of an Expo-compatible library

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo Compatible App</Text>
      {/* Example of using an Expo Location API call instead of an unsupported library */}
    </View>
  );
}

// In the bugSolution.js file, we would replace any use of 'unavailable-library' with suitable alternatives compatible with Expo's managed workflow.
